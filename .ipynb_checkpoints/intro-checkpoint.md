## Bienvnidos a Jupyter
Este es un primer ejemplo de libro con jupyter:
```{math}
:label: my_label
w_{t+1} = (1 + r_{t+1}) s(w_t) + y_{t+1}
```
It shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.
It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.

Check out the content pages bundled with this sample book to see more.
